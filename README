# Visit https://playwright.dev/docs/intro for more information. ✨

# Recording and generating the Test Cases:- 

  under the testing extension -> at bottom PLAYWRIGHT -> Under the tools -> select Record new

# Running the test cases on different Browsers :-

1.  under the testing extension -> at bottom PLAYWRIGHT -> Under the projects -> select the browser on which you want to test
2.  undet the config.ts, goto the projects and uncomment the browsers you need and comment out that you dont need

# Making the HTML Report in human readable form :-

1. Under your test file -> inside the function write the below code for each step and this make html into humand readable form

    await test.step("Message you want to see on report", async () => {
